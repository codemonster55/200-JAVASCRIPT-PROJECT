# Typing Speed Test

## Description

The Typing Speed Test project is a web application designed to measure a user's typing speed and accuracy by presenting them with a passage of text to type. It allows users to practice their typing skills, track their typing speed, and identify areas for improvement.

## Features

- **Typing Passage**: Provide users with a passage of text to type, ranging from simple sentences to longer paragraphs or quotes.
- **Real-Time Typing**: Track the user's typing in real-time as they input the text, capturing keystrokes, errors, and completion time.
- **Accuracy Calculation**: Calculate the user's typing accuracy by comparing their typed text with the original passage and identifying errors or mistakes.
- **Words per Minute (WPM)**: Calculate the user's typing speed in words per minute (WPM) based on the number of words typed and the completion time.
- **Error Analysis**: Provide feedback on typing errors, including mistyped characters, missed spaces, and incorrect words, to help users identify areas for improvement.
- **Customizable Settings**: Allow users to customize the typing test settings, including the length and difficulty of the passage, timer options, and feedback preferences.
- **Leaderboard (Optional)**: Implement a leaderboard to display high scores and rankings based on users' typing speeds and accuracy.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the Typing Speed Test is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Utilize JavaScript for implementing real-time typing tracking, accuracy calculation, and user interactions.
- **HTML**: Structure the web pages using HTML to create the layout and content of the Typing Speed Test, including the typing passage and user interface elements.
- **CSS**: Style the application with CSS to enhance its appearance, layout, and visual effects.
- **Timer Functionality**: Implement timer functionality using JavaScript to track the user's typing speed and completion time, with options for setting time limits or counting down from a specified duration.
- **LocalStorage**: Store user preferences and typing test results locally on the user's device using browser storage mechanisms (e.g., localStorage or IndexedDB) for data persistence.
- **Responsive Design Frameworks (Optional)**: Implement responsive design frameworks like Bootstrap or Materialize to ensure compatibility with various devices and screen sizes while maintaining a consistent user experience.
