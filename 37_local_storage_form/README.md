# Local Storage Form

## Description

The Local Storage Form project is a web application that demonstrates how to use the browser's local storage to save and retrieve form data. This project provides users with a way to store form inputs locally so that the data persists even after the page is refreshed or the browser is closed and reopened. This can be useful for various purposes such as creating drafts, saving user preferences, or temporarily storing data before submission.

## Features

- **Save Form Data**: Automatically save form inputs to local storage as the user types.
- **Retrieve Form Data**: Retrieve and populate form inputs with saved data when the page is loaded.
- **Clear Form Data**: Provide an option to clear the saved data from the form and local storage.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic to save, retrieve, and clear form data in local storage, and handling user interactions.
- **HTML**: For structuring the form interface, including input fields, buttons, and any other necessary elements.
- **CSS**: For styling the form and enhancing the user experience with visually appealing designs.

## Setup

To set up and run the Local Storage Form project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the project.

3. **Open Index.html**: Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to view the Local Storage Form.

4. **Fill Out the Form**: Enter data into the form fields. The data will be automatically saved to local storage as you type.
