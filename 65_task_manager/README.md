## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For implementing dynamic functionality, handling user interactions, and updating the user interface.
- **HTML**: For structuring the web page layout and embedding elements such as forms, buttons, and task cards within the document.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page layout, including typography, colors, spacing, alignment, and visual aesthetics, to create an appealing user interface.
- **Backend Framework (Optional)**: Optionally uses a backend framework (e.g., Node.js with Express) to handle HTTP requests, manage user sessions, serve static files, and interact with the database.
- **Database (Optional)**: Optionally integrates with a backend database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) to store task data, user profiles, settings, and other application data securely.
- **User Authentication (Optional)**: Optionally implements user authentication and authorization mechanisms using technologies such as JWT, OAuth, or Firebase Authentication to secure user accounts and protect personal data.
- **Deployment**: Deploys the application to a web hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, Netlify, Vercel) to make it accessible to users on the internet.
