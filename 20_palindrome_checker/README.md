# Palindrome Checker

## Description

The Palindrome Checker project is a web application that allows users to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. This tool helps users quickly determine whether a string is a palindrome or not.

## Features

- **String Input**: Allow users to input a string to check if it is a palindrome.
- **Palindrome Detection**: Detect whether the input string is a palindrome or not, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
- **Feedback**: Provide immediate feedback to users on whether the input string is a palindrome or not.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For implementing the palindrome checking logic and providing real-time feedback to users.
- **HTML**: For structuring the palindrome checker interface, including input fields and result display.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and enhancing the user experience with visually appealing designs.
