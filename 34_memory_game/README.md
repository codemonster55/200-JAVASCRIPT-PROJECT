# Memory Game

## Description

The Memory Game project is a web application that challenges users to match pairs of cards. This game helps improve memory and concentration skills. The game displays a grid of cards, all face down initially. Players flip over two cards at a time to find matching pairs. The game continues until all pairs are matched.

## Features

- **Card Matching**: Players flip over cards to find matching pairs.
- **Grid Layout**: A customizable grid layout for different levels of difficulty (e.g., 4x4, 6x6).
- **Timer**: A timer to track how long it takes the player to complete the game.
- **Move Counter**: Count the number of moves a player makes to complete the game.
