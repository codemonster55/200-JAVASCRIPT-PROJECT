# Calculator

## Description

The Calculator project is a web-based application that provides users with a simple and intuitive tool for performing mathematical calculations. It allows users to input numerical expressions, perform basic arithmetic operations, and obtain accurate results instantly. The Calculator aims to streamline mathematical computations and improve productivity for users across various fields and applications.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Support standard arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, to perform mathematical calculations.
- **Memory Functions**: Provide memory functions such as memory storage (M+), memory recall (MR), and memory clear (MC) to store and retrieve intermediate results during calculations.
- **Decimal and Fractional Input**: Allow users to input decimal numbers and fractions for precise calculations and accurate results.
- **Clear and All Clear Functions**: Offer clear (C) and all clear (AC) functions to reset the input field or clear the entire calculation history, respectively.
- **Keyboard and Mouse Support**: Enable users to input numbers and perform operations using both keyboard inputs (numeric keys, operators) and mouse clicks.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the Calculator application is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Utilize JavaScript for implementing calculator functionalities, mathematical operations, user interactions, and input validations.
- **HTML**: Structure the web pages using HTML to create the layout and user interface components of the Calculator application, including input fields, buttons, and display areas.
- **CSS**: Style the application with CSS to enhance its appearance, layout, and visual effects, including styling for buttons, input fields, and user interface elements.

## Setup

To set up and run the Calculator project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you cloned the project.

3. **Open Index.html or Start the Development Server**: Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser to access the Calculator application. Alternatively, if the project requires a development server, follow the setup instructions provided in the project documentation to start the server.
