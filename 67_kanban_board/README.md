# Kanban Board

## Description

The Kanban Board project is a web application designed to help teams manage their tasks and workflow using the Kanban method. It provides a visual representation of tasks as cards organized into columns representing different stages of the workflow, allowing teams to track the progress of tasks from start to finish.

## Features

- **Task Cards**: Tasks are represented as cards that contain information such as title, description, assignee, due date, priority, and status.
- **Column-based Workflow**: Tasks are organized into columns representing different stages of the workflow (e.g., To Do, In Progress, Done), allowing users to visualize the progress of tasks as they move through the workflow.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Users can easily move tasks between columns using drag-and-drop functionality, allowing them to update task status and prioritize work efficiently.
- **Task Details**: Users can view and edit task details by clicking on individual task cards, allowing them to update task information, add comments, attach files, and track task history.
- **Task Filtering and Searching**: Users can filter and search for tasks based on various criteria such as assignee, due date, priority, status, or keyword, making it easy to find specific tasks quickly.
- **Task Assignment and Notifications**: Users can assign tasks to team members and receive notifications or reminders for upcoming deadlines or important events.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple users can collaborate on the same board in real-time, allowing teams to work together seamlessly and stay updated on task progress.
- **Customization**: Users can customize board settings, add new columns, create custom labels, and configure workflow rules to match their team's unique requirements.
- **Data Persistence**: Board data is saved securely, ensuring that task information and board configurations are preserved even after closing the browser or refreshing the page.
- **User Authentication and Authorization (Optional)**: Optionally, the application may implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure user accounts, data privacy, and prevent unauthorized access.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones, ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For implementing dynamic functionality, handling user interactions, and updating the user interface.
- **HTML**: For structuring the web page layout and embedding elements such as task cards, columns, buttons, and forms within the document.
- **CSS**: For styling the web page layout, including typography, colors, spacing, alignment, and visual aesthetics, to create an appealing user interface.
- **Backend Framework (Optional)**: Optionally uses a backend framework (e.g., Node.js with Express) to handle HTTP requests, manage user sessions, serve static files, and interact with the database.
- **Database (Optional)**: Optionally integrates with a backend database (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL) to store board data, user profiles, settings, and other application data securely.
- **User Authentication (Optional)**: Optionally implements user authentication and authorization mechanisms using technologies such as JWT, OAuth, or Firebase Authentication to secure user accounts and protect personal data.
- **Deployment**: Deploys the application to a web hosting platform (e.g., Heroku, Netlify, Vercel) to make it accessible to users on the internet.
