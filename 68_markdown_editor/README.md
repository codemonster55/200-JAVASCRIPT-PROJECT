# Markdown Editor

## Description

The Markdown Editor project is a web application designed to provide a user-friendly interface for writing and previewing Markdown-formatted text. Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text formatting syntax, which can be converted to HTML or other rich text formats. The Markdown Editor allows users to compose Markdown text in a convenient editor pane and instantly preview the rendered HTML output in a separate pane, making it easy to create well-formatted documents, blog posts, README files, and more.

## Features

- **Live Preview**: Renders a real-time preview of the Markdown text as HTML, allowing users to see how the formatted content will appear in the final document.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Highlights Markdown syntax elements in the editor pane to improve readability and help users identify different parts of their document.
- **Side-by-Side View**: Displays the Markdown editor and the live preview side by side or in separate tabs, giving users flexibility in their editing and previewing workflow.
- **Fullscreen Mode**: Allows users to switch to fullscreen mode for distraction-free writing and editing, maximizing the available screen space for the editor and preview panes.
- **Export to HTML**: Enables users to export the Markdown content as HTML code or download the rendered HTML file for use in other applications or publishing platforms.
- **Import Markdown Files**: Supports importing existing Markdown files from local storage or external sources, allowing users to continue editing or previewing previously created documents.
