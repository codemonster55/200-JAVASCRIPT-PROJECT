# Language Translator

## Description

The Language Translator project is a web application that allows users to translate text from one language to another. This tool can be used for various purposes such as learning new languages, translating documents, or communicating with people who speak different languages. Users can input text, select the source and target languages, and receive the translated text instantly.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Allow users to input or paste text that they want to translate.
- **Language Selection**: Provide options for selecting the source and target languages for translation.
- **Instant Translation**: Display the translated text instantly after processing the input.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For implementing the translation functionality, typically using an external API such as Google Translate API, and handling user interactions.
- **HTML**: For structuring the Language Translator interface, including input fields, language selection dropdowns, and the output display area.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and enhancing the user experience with visually appealing designs.

4. **Obtain API Key**: If using an external translation API, obtain an API key from the service provider (e.g., Google Cloud Platform for Google Translate API).
